# DevOps Best Practices Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the DevOps best practices implemented in the WordPress Server Automation project and provides guidance for maintaining these standards.

## Configuration Management

### 1. Externalized Configuration
- All hardcoded values moved to configuration files
- Environment-specific overrides supported via `.env` files
- Hierarchical configuration management
- Default fallback values for all settings

### 2. Configuration Hierarchy
```
Environment Variables (highest priority)
  ↓
.env file settings
  ↓
global.conf settings
  ↓
Script defaults (lowest priority)
```

### 3. Secret Management
- Passwords and sensitive data externalized
- Configuration files have restricted permissions (600)
- No secrets committed to version control
- Environment-specific credential management

## Infrastructure as Code

### 1. Declarative Configuration
- All system settings defined in configuration files
- Idempotent script execution
- Version-controlled infrastructure definitions
- Reproducible deployments across environments

### 2. Modular Architecture
- Separated concerns across modules
- Independent module execution
- Clear interfaces between components
- Reusable configuration patterns

## Security Hardening

### 1. Default Security Posture
- Deny-by-default firewall rules
- Least privilege access patterns
- Encrypted communications (SSL/TLS)
- Regular security updates

### 2. Dynamic Security Features
- IP-based access restrictions
- Fail2ban integration
- Real-time threat monitoring
- Automated security responses

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Comprehensive Monitoring
- System metrics collection
- Application performance monitoring
- Security event logging
- Resource utilization tracking

### 2. Alerting Strategy
- Threshold-based alerting
- Multiple notification channels
- Alert fatigue prevention
- Escalation procedures

### 3. Log Management (NEW)
- Single-command log access (`wp-logs`, `wp-logs-follow`)
- Real-time log monitoring and following
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Centralized log viewing across all services
- Automated log rotation and retention

## Environment Management

### 1. Environment Separation
- Development, staging, production configurations
- Environment-specific variable overrides
- Isolated credential management
- Consistent deployment patterns

### 2. Configuration Templates
```bash
# Production example
DATABASE_HOST="prod-mysql.internal"
WP_DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@company.com"
REDIS_BIND_ADDRESS="prod-redis.internal"
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL="ssl@company.com"

# Development example  
DATABASE_HOST="localhost"
WP_DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL="dev@localhost"
REDIS_BIND_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1"
```

## Deployment Automation

### 1. Automated Installation
- Unattended installation procedures
- Configuration validation
- Dependency management
- Error handling and rollback

### 2. Health Checks
- System readiness verification
- Service health monitoring
- Configuration validation
- Performance benchmarking

## Backup and Recovery

### 1. Automated Backups
- Scheduled backup procedures
- Configuration and data backups
- Retention policy management
- Backup verification

### 2. Disaster Recovery
- Recovery procedures documentation
- Configuration restoration
- Data recovery processes
- Business continuity planning

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Hardware-Aware Tuning
- Automatic resource detection
- Performance profile generation
- Workload-specific optimization
- Continuous performance monitoring

### 2. Caching Strategies
- Multi-layer caching implementation
- Cache invalidation procedures
- Performance metrics tracking
- Cache optimization recommendations

## Maintenance Procedures

### 1. Update Management
- Automated security updates
- Application update procedures
- Configuration drift detection
- Change validation processes

### 2. System Maintenance
- Log rotation and management
- Temporary file cleanup
- Performance optimization
- Security patch management

## Implementation Examples

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp config/.env.example config/.env

# Edit for your environment
vim config/.env

# Validate configuration
./master.sh --dry-run config
```

### Security Hardening
```bash
# Apply security policies
./master.sh security

# Verify security configuration
./master.sh --status security

# Monitor security events - NEW APPROACH
wp-logs-follow              # Follow all logs in real-time
wp-logs fail2ban            # View security log specifically
wp-logs -s "blocked" fail2ban # Search for blocked IPs
```

### Performance Tuning
```bash
# Apply performance optimization
./master.sh dynamic-tuning

# Monitor performance metrics
server-dashboard

# Benchmark performance
ab -n 1000 -c 10 https://yoursite.com/
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Configuration Problems
1. Verify configuration file syntax
2. Check file permissions
3. Validate environment variables
4. Review log files for errors

### Security Issues
1. Check firewall rules
2. Verify SSL certificate status
3. Review fail2ban logs
4. Validate access controls

### Performance Problems
1. Monitor resource utilization
2. Check cache hit rates
3. Review database performance
4. Analyze application metrics

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly configuration reviews
- Quarterly security assessments
- Semi-annual performance evaluations
- Annual disaster recovery testing
