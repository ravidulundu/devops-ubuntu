Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Design Details
Script Structure and Core Modules
Master Management Script (master.sh): Central controller for all modules.

Installation Module (install.sh): Installs OpenLiteSpeed, CyberPanel, and all dependencies.

Configuration Module (config.sh): Optimizes server and service settings.

Security Module (security.sh): Implements firewall, WAF, SSL, and additional server hardening.

WordPress Automation Module (wp-automation.sh): Manages WordPress installation, cache/CDN integration, backups, and updates.

Monitoring & Logging Module (monitoring.sh): Collects resource, access, and threat logs; delivers alerts.

Dynamic Tuning Module (dynamic-tuning.sh):

Detects server hardware status (RAM, CPU, disk, etc.).

Optimizes PHP, OpenLiteSpeed, LSAPI parameters (process count, memory limit, pool buffer) based on available hardware.

Can operate independently; directly impacts metrics such as Lighthouse and TTFB.

Designed with an extensible interface for future CPU/GPU/disk/network tuning modules.

Advanced Security Module: Dynamic IP and Domain Whitelisting
Whenever the public IP at home changes, a script running on a Windows 11 machine detects the new public IP and updates the "ip.dulundu.tools" A record via the Cloudflare API.

On the server, an automation module periodically resolves this domain and updates the firewall/security policies to whitelist the resulting IP, removing obsolete entries.

Server access (SSH, control panel, custom ports) is permitted only through this dynamically updated IP; all other connections are denied.

Scripts are triggered via command line, events, or cron jobs to minimize update latency.

Cloudflare Python API or equivalent libraries will be used.

This infrastructure serves as the primary security reference for minimizing unauthorized access.

Module Interactions
Modules are triggered through the master management script using flags or parameters.

Data flow: Installation ➔ Configuration ➔ Security ➔ Application Deployment ➔ Monitoring.

The dynamic tuning module can run post-install or independently, and integrates with other module parameters.

All outputs are centrally logged and reported.

Optimization Methods
Custom OpenLiteSpeed tuning (gzip, caching, max execution time).

Automated detection and configuration of PHP and LSAPI advanced parameters (process counts, memory, buffers) based on server resources.

Real-time resource monitoring with proactive alerting and recommendations.

Dynamic security defense using Fail2ban and UFW rules.

Hardware optimization directly improves site speed and performance scores (Lighthouse, TTFB).

Extensible tuning interface to accommodate integration of additional tuning methods.

Architectural Overview
Core Principles:

Modularity, automation, documentation, and minimal human intervention.

Component Communication:

Bash script calls and standard I/O streams; syslog and basic email/Telegram API integration for monitoring and logging.

Design Patterns:

Separation of Concerns, Dependency Injection (via config parameters), idempotent operations.

Dynamic Tuning Integration:

The tuning module can be rerun for new hardware profiles or changing server loads, ensuring continual optimization.

Extensibility:

Base interface for future automatic tuning modules, e.g., CPU/GPU/disk/network.

System Interfaces
Existing System Interfaces
Integration with CyberPanel and OpenLiteSpeed via scripts and configuration APIs.

WordPress automation through WP-CLI and supporting scripts.

Monitoring and alerting via syslog, email, or messaging APIs.

Advanced Security Module Integration
Domain A record automation using Cloudflare Python API (or equivalent).

Bash or Python scripts resolve the domain and update firewall whitelists.

Cron or event-based triggers ensure rapid updates.

Firewall policies permit access only to the latest whitelisted IP, performing instant cleanup of previous entries.

Only whitelisted IPs are permitted for SSH, panel, and custom port management.

Data Structures and Algorithms
Core Data Structures
Core Algorithms
Idempotent Resource Provisioning: Ensures scripts are repeatable and do not produce adverse side effects.

Configuration Validation: Verifies configurations; supports automated rollback in case of failure.

Real-Time Resource Monitoring: Actively monitors CPU, RAM, and disk; activates alerts based on set thresholds.

Dynamic Hardware Optimization:

Auto-detects hardware and system load.

Adjusts PHP and OpenLiteSpeed parameters, e.g.:

PHP memory_limit, max_children, max_requests

OpenLiteSpeed worker process count

LSAPI process buffer settings

Example:

For a server with 2GB RAM, sets memory_limit to 256MB.

For an 8 vCPU server, automatically increases worker/process count.

Extensible Tuning Algorithm: Base logic designed for easy extension to support disk, network, and GPU optimizations.

Page Speed Optimization: Automatically orchestrates optimizations to boost Lighthouse, TTFB, and similar metrics, with results fed back to the system.

Dynamic IP/Domain Whitelisting Algorithm:

Windows script discovers current public IP and updates domain via Cloudflare API.

Server script resolves domain and refreshes firewall rules with new IP, purging old entries.

Ensures only the current IP is granted access at all times.

Security
Core Security Measures
Firewall and Network Access: Uses UFW/firewall with a default deny policy and minimal open ports.

Mandatory SSL: Automates SSL via Let's Encrypt for all web and panel traffic.

Web Application Firewall (WAF): Layered protection via OpenLiteSpeed’s built-in WAF or external ModSecurity.

Brute Force Protection: Implements dynamic bans for SSH, panel, and WordPress brute-force attempts using Fail2ban.

Backup and Rollback: Automatic snapshots after all critical operations.

Threat Detection and Alerting: Monitoring module leverages log analysis to trigger automated responses based on detected attack types.

Advanced Security Module: Dynamic IP and Domain Whitelisting
Script running on a Windows 11 machine identifies changes to the home public IP and updates the "ip.dulundu.tools" A record through the Cloudflare API.

Server-side automation resolves the domain every set interval, updating firewall whitelists and removing outdated IPs.

SSH, control panel, and custom port access are strictly limited to the dynamically updated IP; all other connections are blocked by default.

Cloudflare Python API (or equivalent) integration ensures instant whitelisting upon IP change detection.

The automation process effectively reduces risks of unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.

All whitelist actions are logged separately for auditing and reporting purposes.
